            Elon Reeve Musk born (June 28, 1971)is a business magnate and investor. Musk is the
            founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, product architect and
            former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company;
            co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the
            world, with an estimated net worth of US$217 billion as of August 2023, according to the Bloomberg
            Billionaires Index, and $219 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in both Tesla
            and SpaceX.[3][4][5]

            Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating
            to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.[6] Two years later, he
            matriculated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Musk later transferred to the University of
            Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics there. He moved to California in 1995
            to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal,
            co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in
            1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com
            merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.

            In 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made,
            Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric
            vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect,
            assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk heled create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was
            acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain
            transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company.
            The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer
            interfaces—and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44
            billion and subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the
            following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.<br>

            </h1>
            <p class="para">
                Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of South Africa's capital cities.
                Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. His mother, Maye Musk (née Haldeman), is a
                model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa. His father,
                Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property
                developer, who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika. Musk has a
                younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.

                Musk's family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a
                representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their
                father's dislike of apartheid. His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born
                Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine
                Bellanca airplane. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his
                father. Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.He has a
                paternal half-sister and a half-brother.

                Maye Musk has said of her son that he "was shy and awkward at school" and "didn't have many
                friends". At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to
                program from the VIC-20 user manual. At age twelve, he sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and
                Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.

            <h1>Education:-

            </h1>
            <p>Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and Pretoria Boys High School,
                from where he graduated. Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born
                mother, knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way. While
                waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.

                Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,
                working odd jobs at a farm and lumber mill.In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston,
                Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), where he
                completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics
                from the Wharton School. Although Musk claims he earned the degrees in 1995, UPenn
                maintains it awarded them in 1997.He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay
                for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google
                Books.

                In 1994, Musk held two internship Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research
                Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo
                Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.In 1995, he was accepted to a PhD program in materials
                science at Stanford University. However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom, dropping out
                two days after being accepted and applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a
                response.</p><br>

            </h1>
            <p>In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2. Errol Musk provided them with
                $28,000 in funding. The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow
                pages, and marketed it to newspapers. They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto, with
                Musk coding the website every night. Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and
                the Chicago Tribune. The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with
                CitySearch; however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307
                million in cash in February 1999, and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.<br>


                usk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017, and had previously questioned the
                platform's commitment to freedom of speech. In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter
                shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April, making him the largest shareholde When this was
                publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013
                IPO. On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and
                prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.However, on April 13, Musk made a
                $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per
                share. In response, Twitter's board adopted a "poison pill" shareholder rights plan to make it
                more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.
                Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44
                billion.This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in
                equity financing.

            <p>Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[258][259] whose stated purpose is to provide
                solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests
                including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and "safe artificial intelligence"); and
                support science and engineering educational efforts.[260] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25
                million directly to non-profit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[261] which was
                a non-profit at the time.[262]

                Since 2002, the foundation has made over 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific
                research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater
                the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's non-profit Big Green.[263] In 2012, Musk took
                the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either
                during his lifetime or in his will.[264] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100
                million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[265]

                Vox said "the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque",
                noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[261] The foundation has been criticized for the
                relatively small amount of wealth donated.[266] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1,
                because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[263] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7
                billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[267] However, Bloomberg News
                noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at
                the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to non-profits that year.[268]
